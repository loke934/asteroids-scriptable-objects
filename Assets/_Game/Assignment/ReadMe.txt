Hi!
The scripts and assets are divided after assignment, 
but the changes in Asteroid.cs is related to both Score UI Update and Asteroid Destroyer so that's
why it's in the main assignment folder.

I've tried to use scriptable events for screen wrapping using a Vector3 event and an int observable 
for the UI update on number of asteroids destroyed.
Asteroid splitting into small asteroids uses a Int event and I use a runtime set to keep track and find the 
right asteroid to split up. 

I've tried to follow the guidelines for vg.
